# Competitive Programming AC Submissions

This repo contains all of my AC submissions from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/simon7426/)), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/submissions/Simon7426)) & [LightOJ](https://lightoj.com/user/rian66746) accounts. It also includes a "Helper" folder that contains algorithms and data structures that I have implemented and used. (Last Updated 2022-10-04)

The codeforces portion of this repo was generated using a modified version of [UpCode](https://github.com/crapthecoder/UpCode) and the leetcode portion was generated using [leetdoad](https://github.com/jiachengxu/leetdoad).
